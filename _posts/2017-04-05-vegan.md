      <p>The cheapest and most delicious vegan food in Novosibirsk. They have about 5 things on their menu from tofu wraps to veggie burgers to falafel wraps. They are all adequately sized for the price. It does usually take 10-15 minutes to prepare, making it not too-fast food, but the food and quantity is well worth the wait. It's located in Central Park, with great places to walk around or ride some rides with the family. </p> <p><a href=" https://2gis.ru/novosibirsk/query/veggie%20Pit/firm/70000001020956599?queryState=center%2F82.923785%2C55.034869%2Fzoom%2F18 "></a>Find on 2GIS</p>
