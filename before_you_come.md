# 6 Things you need to know about before coming to Novosibirsk:

# 1. Learn the Cyrillic alphabet:
### Knowing the Cyrillic alphabet can be very helpful when finding your way around Novosibirsk. It's important to know street signs, metro stops, and major signs like "bank." A great place to learn is [Cyrillic Alphabet](http://www.russianlessons.net/lessons/lesson1_main.php 'Russian Lesson 1')


# 2. Look for the cross, when looking for a pharmacy.
### You can get anything from shampoo to over the counter medication if you're ever feeling sick or someone gets injured.

# 3. Download Google Translate Russian language.
### If downloaded, you can translate items without wifi. This includes translating photos of menus, ingredients, or directions.

# 4. Downloading the city of Novosibirsk on 2GIS,
### You will notice links to places using 2GIS and not Google Maps on visitnsk.com. This is for a good reason. A lot of places in Novosibirsk won't have signs. There will be a huge building that you are supposed to find a rock climbing center in, with no indication of a rock gym.
### The wonderful thing about 2GIS is they show you the entrance, floor number, and any other helpful information. When you visit other cities in Russia, it's recommended to download the new city before you go. Download here: [Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=ru.dublgis.dgismobile&hl=en "2GIS") [Apple](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/2gis-offline-maps/id481627348?mt=8 "2GIS")

# 5. Learn some conversational Russian?
### Here are some phrases.
#### Zdrasvotyeh: hello
#### G'dyeh: Where?
#### Example of important use: G'dyeh toilet?
#### Chorosho: Okay, good, fine
#### Ya ne ponemyao par rouski: I don't understand Russian
#### Ya hachoo (I want) coffee-piva(beer)-vino(wine)


#### And there, you're set to go! If you want a better lesson, check out [Basic Russian Phrases](http://www.russianlessons.net/lessons/lesson3_main.php "basic Russian phrases")

#### I recommend Pimsleur to learn survival Russian. It's expensive but well worth if you want to be able to speak while you're here. Do all of the lessons before you arrive!
#### You can also take classes here if that's something you're interested in. You can take them at a language school like [Exolingo](https://www.exlinguo.com/en/russian-course/russia/novosibirsk "Exolingo") or at [NSU](http://www.nsu.ru/ciep_programs "Novosibirsk State University"). They will give you a visa and sometimes living arrangements with a Russian family. Many people who have taken these lessons are already conversational after a few months.

# 6. Bring your passport *everywhere* you go.
### You probably won't be stopped by any police, but simple things like renting skiis or a bike will require a passport.
