The traditional way is to go with a group of friends and family and bring food and drinks with you. The sauna can be up to 100C. It's custom to hit each other with tree branches, jump in an icy pool, or go outside in the fresh brisk air. (It's supposed to be healthy for circulation)</p><p><a>Find a banya on 2GIS</a></p>

        <p><strong>What to see</strong> Ice Diving is a winter sport associated with the Christian holiday, Epiphany, when the clock strikes midnight on the 19th of January. Despite this happening many places in the world, it's a special thrill when it's -20C outside. Whether you are religious or not, ice water makes for a good story to talk about back home. Apparently it's <i>also</i> good for circulation. They usually will have tents to change in. Make sure to bring a thermos with some hot tea and wear many layers so you don't get sick.
